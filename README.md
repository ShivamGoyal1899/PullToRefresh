# Building Flutter PullToRefresh in just 15 minutes

## Introduction

The pull-to-refresh pattern lets a user pull down on a list of data using touch in order to retrieve more data. The “Pull-to-refresh” gesture was first introduced by Loren Brichter in the Tweetie app and in no time it became so popular that countless apps adopted this gesture. Today “pull-to-refresh” feature is a natural part of many popular apps, including Twitter, Gmail, Tweetbot and others.

### What you’ll build?

In this tutorial, you’ll build a mobile app featuring a PullToRefresh gesture using the Flutter SDK. Your app will:

* Display a dynamic list with a random number of items

* Each time you **PullToRefresh** the no of items will change in the list

This tutorial focuses on adding a PullToRefresh gesture to a Flutter app. Non-relevant concepts and code blocks are glossed over and are provided for you to simply copy and paste.

## Coding the component

### Component Syntax

The basic format of PullToRefresh gesture looks like the one below:
```dart 
    const RefreshIndicator({
          Key key,
          @required Widget child,
          double displacement: 40.0,
          @required RefreshCallback onRefresh,
          Color color,
          Color backgroundColor,
          ScrollNotificationPredicate
              notificationPredicate: defaultScrollNotificationPredicate,
          String semanticsLabel,
          String semanticsValue
    })
```
### Implementation

The most generic way to implement PullToRefresh is as follows:
```dart 
    const RefreshIndicator({
      Key key,
      @required this.child,
      this.displacement = 40.0,
      @required this.onRefresh,
      this.color,
      this.backgroundColor,
      this.notificationPredicate = defaultScrollNotificationPredicate,
      this.semanticsLabel,
      this.semanticsValue,
    }) : assert(child != null),
         assert(onRefresh != null),
         assert(notificationPredicate != null),
         super(key: key);
```
### Importing dart libraries to main.dart file

Import **dart:async** & **dart:math **libraries to your main.dart file by adding the following line at the starting of the file:
```dart 
    import 'dart:async';
    import 'dart:math';
```
### Putting Code in action

Amend your main.dart file as per the following code:

### Building & running the application

* Connect your Emulator or physical Android device to test the application.

* Click on Build & Run.

* And Boooom, your app is ready.
The final build would look like the below illustration.
